						<b>What is this site all about ?</b><br>
						Using this site, you can send gifts to your friends on Orkut. Select a gift image to be placed inside the gift wrapper and select the time when the gift is allowed to be opened.
						Then copy paste code at the bottom of the page to the orkut scrap book of your friends. Your friend can see the gift at the time you have specified
						<br><br>

						<b>Can the flash code from this site be embedded in other sites ?</b><br>
						Yes, any sites that accepts flash can use this. You can check out MySpace, blogs etc. If you can send flash in e-mails, you can use this code for that too.
						<br><br>
						
						<b>Sometimes gifts do not appear, why ?</b><br>
						The gift images are loaded from an external server and may take some time to be displayed. Check if the Gift URL that you have specified is valid. Currently you can only upload JPEGs. We are working on getting GIFs and PNGs.
						Images with white background will look good on the themes. 
						<br><br>
						
						<b>Why do you only have templates for christmas and birthday ?</b><br>
						We wanted to get the first cut out, so we went ahead with christmas and birthday. However, our "very talented" graphics designer is working hard to get skins / themes for other occassions also.
						<br><br>
						
						<b>Are you guys planning to add more features ?</b><br>
						Sure, tons of more feature requests. Typically, things like letting only the reciever see the gifts (Deepika's idea), longer message lengths (Simi wanted this), customizable backgrounds (courtsey Jyothi) and stuff. If you have an idea, send it across to us. 
						<br><br>
						
						<b>Why did you do this ?</b><br>
						Well, one of us has a friend, and she would not talk to him. It was her birthday on Saturday, and he wanted to wish her. 
						She would just not talk to him, so he made this so that people could send this to her, and hence she would hear him. 
						Actually, he even claims that this site is dedicated to her !! 
						OK, fine..just kidding. We did this coz we thought that the idea was cool, and people will like it. We like javascript and flash, and were challenged to do something non-trivial that did not require a backend.
						So here is our answer to that challenge, but we are still fighting over the "non-trivial" part of this application.

						We are not responsible for any content of gifts placed in the application, or any messages sent to friends. The site shall take no liability for any damages caused by any reason.
						We are not responsible for any copyright images used inside the gifts, or any other problems caused. 
						<br>
						Blah..Blah..Blah..in short, we did this as a hobby project, so use it in good spirits, and don't get us any trouble !
